My favorite color is purple. My birthday is December 1st. I like the following things.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Bicycles (repairing and riding)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Caffeine\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Computers (building, fixing, and using)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Mathematics (mostly number theory)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Solving Pointless Problems (Advent of Code, Codeforces, Leetcode, Project Euler)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Teaching (mainly through YouTube videos)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Web Scraping\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>I like other things too; these are just the main ones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Games\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I used to play video games a lot. I don&#39;t really play them any more. In case you play/have played games, here is a list of my top 5.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4>#5: Bloons TD 1 through 6 (151 hours on Steam, many more on mobile)\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>I have played this game on Cool Math Games in elementary school all the way through college. Isn&#39;t it just great watching monkeys throw darts at ballons?\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4>#4: Grand Theft Auto V (968 hours on Steam, ~200 hours on Xbox 360)\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>Super fun story mode. Super fun online mode. It&#39;s hard not to love this game.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4>#3: Minecraft (countless hours)\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>My childhood was basically just Minecraft and my time spent with friends on this game. It&#39;s a great game that encouraged me to be more creative. It also introduced me to hosting my own game server and using a command line.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4>#2: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (2,088 hours on Steam)\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>I have way too many hours on this game. It would be strange if it wasn&#39;t in my top 5. There are so many areas to improve upon in this game (aiming, movement, communication, utility usage, economy) and so many community servers and game modes that you can spend hundreds or maye even thousands of hours on (like I have done).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4>#1: Terraria (628 hours on Steam)\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>Terraria is a sick fucking game. You can ride a unicorn, shoot a rainbow gun, invert your screen, and fight Cthulu all at the same time. The amount of bosses in this game is great and if you ever by the slightest chance get bored of the game&#39;s base content, the mods are even more incredible. Such a fun game with so many good memories.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>What I Mostly Do\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I write code. The result of that code is usually in the form of a webpage like the one you see right now. Sometimes it&#39;s a \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/xDimGG/starboard\">chat bot\u003C/a> which you can interact with through Discord. Sometimes it&#39;s a \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/xDimGG/xdimgg.github.io/blob/master/remove-youtube-end-cards/endcard.user.js\">Tampermonkey script\u003C/a> that modifies your webpage. Sometimes it&#39;s an \u003Ca href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/steamapi\">NPM package\u003C/a> that conveniently wraps an API for you. Sometimes it&#39;s code that \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/xDimGG/aoc-solutions\">solves a problem\u003C/a>. Sometimes it&#39;s \u003Ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/xDimGG/cc5d80bb2512f2525dd9f52fe4749a32\">code\u003C/a> that scrapes an airline site and gets the best prices for a round flight in a range of dates. Sometimes it&#39;s a \u003Ca href=\"https://recurse-eats.dim.codes/\">GitHub Action\u003C/a> with a cron task that scrapes Uber eats for BOGO deals in some particular area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Bikes\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I like taking things apart and putting them back together. Sometimes I break that thing in the process. I had a fairly rusty 6-year-old mountain bike that was left out in the rain for many college semesters. Here it is after I took it apart, removed a bunch of rust, spray painted some bits, and gave it some new grease, handlebars, pedals, and a chain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/bike_post_repair.jpeg\" alt=\"my mountain bike after repairing it\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I managed to strip all the threads in both crank arms, lose a cable routing plastic bit, and lose a spring in the process. Patched it up with duct tape and the bike rides well. If you need a mechanic, hit me up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Computers\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I got into building computers because I wanted to play computer games but I was only 11 so I didn&#39;t have much money. I explicitly asked my family not to buy me presents and instead to only give me money. Having 6 aunts meant that I was sure to be rich. Thanks to Linus Tech Tips, after collecting a healthy $600, I ordered all the parts that fit my budget. I got myself a brand spanking new R9 380 GPU, an i5-6500 CPU, and \u003Ca href=\"https://pcpartpicker.com/user/DimMagician00/saved/#view=PPmMnQ\">some other parts\u003C/a>. That&#39;s right, a whole 4GB of VRAM. Certainly enough to run Minecraft and CS:GO. With Linus Sebastian by my side, I was able to put together a beast of a computer that would serve me for years to come. In fact, I still use that same graphics card in my PC 9 years later.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Teaching\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I&#39;ve always liked teaching. I don&#39;t really have much public content to show for it; mostly just one-on-ones. I have a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshYVJHJid6Eniih46Ov5QQ\">YouTube channel\u003C/a> where I sometimes upload coding tutorials.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Mathematics\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I&#39;ve always had good grades in math class. This led me to pay attention since I felt like it was the only subject I could understand. Or maybe I understood it because it was the only subject I paid attention in. Who knows. Chicken and egg. I like doing math problems from time to time and have recently done a lot of \u003Ca href=\"https://projecteuler.net/\">Project Euler\u003C/a> problems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Conclusion\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I hope you&#39;ve enjoyed my ramblings and now know a bit more about me. To summarize, I like solving problems, be it mechanical, mathematical, or computational ones. If I don&#39;t understand something, I strive to understand it eventually. I have my vices like caffeine and YouTube. I want to know why we exist and how we got here. I want to learn everything but am aware that humans don&#39;t live long enough to do that. Anyways, thanks for reading. Bye for now ğŸ‘‹\u003C/p>\n"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
