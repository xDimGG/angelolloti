[TL;DR](https://gist.github.com/xDimGG/eaf80e2dfac2e920ca023306b9e72437).\n\n### Some Background\n\nThere is this relatively new airline called Air Premia that provides non-stop flights from four American airports to Incheon Airport in South Korea. As someone who lives near one of the four airports and is interested in visiting Korea, I wanted to capitalize on Air Premia's relatively cheap flight tickets.\n\n### The Problem\n\nBecause of how new Air Premia was, it still wasn't on the radar of many travel sites like Kayak and Expedia. It is now, but it wasn't then.\n\n### The Solution\n\nWrite a Python script to scrape data from Air Premia's site and go through that data to determine when the best time of year is to buy tickets and what tickets were cheapest.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFor starters, let me show you what searching for tickets on [Air Premia](https://www.airpremia.com/) looks like. First, you decide between Roundtrip and One-way. Next, you choose the airport you're departing form. Next, you choose the airport you're arriving at. Next, you click on the date. When clicking on the date, you get a brief loading screen followed by some calendar dates and a price for each applicable date.\n\n![Air Premia calendar UI](/premia_1.png)\n\nWowie, that's a lot of prices at once! After a bit of exploration, I found that you can only book flights up to 9 months in advance. After that, no more prices are shown.\n\n### What is Happening?\n\nWell, when we click on the date selector or click on the arrows to load the next month, our browser is probably making an API request to get the prices given our parameters (departing from terminal, arriving at terminal, etc.). We can confirm that this is the case by opening up our Chrome developer tools and going to the network tab. With this tool, we can see every request that the current tab makes. Refreshing the page and choosing the same options as before, we are able to capture the following request.\n\n![Air Premia API request](/premia_2.png)\n\nOkay, so our browser is making an HTTP GET request to `https://www.airpremia.com/pssapi/lowfare` with some query parameters. Let's format that URL so that we can actually read the parameters. *Note: you can see the same thing by going to the `Payload` tab of the request in Chrome.*\n\n```\nhttps://www.airpremia.com/pssapi/lowfare\n\t?origin=EWR\n\t&destination=ICN\n\t&tripType=RT\n\t&beginDate=2024-01-31\n\t&endDate=2024-02-29\n\t&loyalty=MonetaryOnly\n\t&fareTypes=FI\n\t&currency=USD\n\t&useCache=true\n```\n\nLet's also take a look at the `Response` tab to see what data we're getting back.\n\n![Air Premia API response](/premia_3.png)\n\nAs far as reverse engineering APIs goes, Air Premia is definitely on the easier side of things. All the parameters are clearly written out and the response is in neatly structured JSON data. There are still some guesses we have to make regarding the data that we can confirm by making more requests.\n\nSo, in our request we have the obvious parameters `origin=EWR` and `destination=ICN`, both of which use [IATA Location Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA_airport_code) (EWR for Newark Liberty International Airport and ICN for Incheon International Airport).\n\nThen we have `tripType=RT`. We can guess that this means round-trip and verify this by selecting `One-way` from the UI and seeing that the request the browser sends contains `tripType=OW` instead.\n\nNext is `beginDate=2024-01-31` and `endDate=2024-02-29`. These are also pretty obvious, but it's worth making a note that the format of these dates is `YYYY-MM-DD`.\n\nWe have `currency=USD`, which should be very obvious. Since Air Premia travels to Korea, Thailand, Tokyo, and the U.S., the possible currencies are most likely `KWN`, `THB`, `JPY`, and `USD`. This was confirmed by selecting one-way tickets and changing the departure terminals to different countries.\n\nFinally, we also have `loyalty`, `fareTypes`, and `useCache`. These don't seem very useful so I'll just leave them as they are.\n\n### Now What?\n\nWell, we figured out how the API works. Now, we need to write some code to make requests to these endpoints and store their data in some kind of data structure. I like working with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) since it lets you hold onto variables while writing your code. Anyway, let's import `requests` and try making a GET request to the endpoint with the same parameters as before, but just written out in a dictionary. `raise_for_status()` raises an error if our response has a bad status code. `json()` will just parse the response data in the JSON format.\n\n```py\nimport requests\n\nres = requests.get(\n\t'https://www.airpremia.com/pssapi/lowfare?loyalty=MonetaryOnly&fareTypes=FI&useCache=true',\n\tparams={\n\t\t'tripType': 'RT',\n\t\t'origin': 'EWR',\n\t\t'destination': 'ICN',\n\t\t'beginDate': '2024-01-31',\n\t\t'endDate': '2024-02-29',\n\t\t'currency': 'USD',\n\t},\n)\nres.raise_for_status()\nres.json()\n```\n\nRunning this code, we get back `HTTPError: 400 Client Error`. Annoying but not unexpected. Client requests often require additional headers/cookies in order to work. In this case, after some guess and check of removing and adding headers, it turns out all we need is the `X-Content-ID` header. It doesn't even have to be set to anything... it just has to exist.\n\n```diff\n...\n\t\t'currency': 'USD',\n\t},\n+\theaders={'X-Context-ID': ''},\n)\nres.raise_for_status()\n...\n```\n\nRunning that code again, we now get a JSON response that looks something like this (after being parsed).\n\n```py\n{'data': {'EWR-ICN': [{'date': '2024-01-31',\n    'soldOut': False,\n    'noFights': True,\n\t\t# ...\n  'ICN-EWR': [{'date': '2024-01-31',\n    'soldOut': False,\n    'noFights': True,\n\t\t# ...\n    'PE': None}]}}\n```\n\nSince we are using `tripType=RT`, the response includes the costs for EWR to ICN and ICN to EWR. Let's create a list of dates that we're interested in iterating over. To do this, I'm taking advantage of [python-dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/), which provides some nice convenience methods for generating ranges of dates and mutating date objects.\n\n```py\nfrom datetime import date\nfrom dateutil.rrule import rrule, MONTHLY\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\n\n# Get today's date and replace the day with 1 to be at the beginning of the month\nTODAY = date.today().replace(day=1)\n# Starting from the current month, generate a range with 10 elements at a monthly frequency\ndates = list(rrule(freq=MONTHLY, dtstart=TODAY, count=10))\n# Set every other month's date to the last day of the month\nfor i in range(1, len(dates), 2):\n\tdates[i] += relativedelta(day=31)\n\n# Format the dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD\ndates = [m.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for m in dates]\n```\n\nAfter running this code, our `dates` variable now contains this.\n\n```py\n['2024-01-01',\n '2024-02-29',\n '2024-03-01',\n '2024-04-30',\n '2024-05-01',\n '2024-06-30',\n '2024-07-01',\n '2024-08-31',\n '2024-09-01',\n '2024-10-31']\n```\n\nWould it have been faster to type these out by hand? Yes, but it would not have been as fun.\n\nWith this done, let's start iterating over all the date ranges and getting flight data for all the possible dates. Mind you, we want to query two months at a time. This means that we will have `2024-01-01 through 2024-02-29`, `2024-03-01 through 2024-04-30`, and so on. We are matching every even indexed element with every odd indexed element. To do this, we may use Python's [zip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) function and [array slicing](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_array_slicing.asp).\n\n`dates[::2]` gives us every other element starting from 0 and `dates[1::2]` gives use every other element starting from 1. *Note: `dates[::2]` is implicitly `dates[0:len(dates):2]` and `dates[1::2]` is implicitly `dates[1:len(dates):2]`.* Now that we have these two iterators, we may merge them using `zip`. Let's just do `zip(dates[::2], dates[1::2])` and iterate over it to make sure everything works.\n\n![testing our use of zip](/premia_4.png)\n\nPay attention to the `start, end` in our loop. Each value of `zip()` is returned as a tuple and we can use comma-separated variables to extract the tuple's individual parts. With this done, we may begin making our GET requests. Let's just move our GET request to a function that takes some variables. If `trip_type` is RT, our method returns a tuple containg the flights to our destination and the return flights. If `trip_type` isn't RT, we return only flights going to our destination.\n\n```py\nimport requests\n\ndef fetch(trip_type, origin, destination, start_date, end_date, currency='USD'):\n\tres = requests.get(\n\t\t'https://www.airpremia.com/pssapi/lowfare?loyalty=MonetaryOnly&fareTypes=FI&useCache=true',\n\t\tparams={\n\t\t\t'tripType': trip_type,\n\t\t\t'origin': origin,\n\t\t\t'destination': destination,\n\t\t\t'beginDate': start_date,\n\t\t\t'endDate': end_date,\n\t\t\t'currency': currency,\n\t\t},\n\t\theaders={'X-Context-ID': ''},\n\t)\n\tres.raise_for_status()\n\tdata = res.json()['data']\n\tgoing = data[f'{origin}-{destination}']\n\n\treturn (going, data[f'{destination}-{origin}']) if trip_type == 'RT' else going\n```\n\nNow, let's write a function like `fetch` called `fetch_all` that takes `trip_type`, `origin`, `destination`, and `currency`, and returns every single available flight. Here, we take advantage of [concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor) to concurrently request all date ranges and compile them all into one or two arrays (depending on if `trip_type` is `RT` or `OW`). *Note: this whole OW/RT and value/2-tuple business and is very annoying to write code for. If you know a better way of doing this in Python, please advise.*\n\n```py\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n\ndef fetch_all(trip_type, origin, destination, currency='USD'):\n\tgoing = []\n\tcoming = []\n\n\twith ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n\t\tfor res in executor.map(\n\t\t\t\tlambda args: fetch(trip_type, origin, destination, *args, currency),\n\t\t\t\tzip(dates[::2], dates[1::2])):\n\t\t\tif trip_type == 'RT':\n\t\t\t\tgoing += res[0]\n\t\t\t\tcoming += res[1]\n\t\t\telse:\n\t\t\t\tgoing += res\n\n\treturn (going, coming) if trip_type == 'RT' else going\n```\n\nThis blog post is already getting pretty long. Let me just briefly cover what the rest of the code does. Here, we are taking our arrays, filtering out days which don't have prices, flattening the data, and converting the data to `pandas.DataFrame` objects. The benefit of using pandas is that we get access to a lot of methods to assess our data. *Note: we are using 'E' to represent economy. I mean, who'd go to this extent saving money but also fly premium.*\n\n```py\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom dateutil.parser import parse\n\n# c = 'E' or 'PE' (premium) economy\ndef to_clean_df(data, c='E'):\n\tclean = [{\n\t\t'date': parse(d['date']),\n\t\t'available': d[c]['availableCount'],\n\t\t'fare': d[c]['fareAmount'],\n\t\t'fees': d[c]['taxesAndFeesAmount'],\n\t\t'total': d[c]['fareAmount'] + d[c]['taxesAndFeesAmount'],\n\t} for d in data if d[c] is not None]\n\t\n\treturn pd.DataFrame(clean).sort_values('date')\n\nicn_ow = to_clean_df(ewr_icn_ow) # one-way ewr-icn\newr_ow = to_clean_df(icn_ewr_ow) # one-way icn-ewr\nicn_rt = to_clean_df(ewr_icn_rt) # round-trip price ewr-icn\newr_rt = to_clean_df(icn_ewr_rt) # round-trip price icn-ewr\n\nassert icn_ow.size == icn_rt.size\nassert ewr_ow.size == ewr_rt.size\n```\n\nLet's write a bit of code to find the `n` cheapest trips given a date range we want the trip to be during, the minimum number of days the trip should be, and the maximum number of days the trip should be. This code could be optimized by avoiding a lot of unnecessary iteration and using a heap queue. *Note: `leaving` and `returning` are `pandas.DataFrame` objects, not lists.*\n\n```py\ndef n_cheapest_trips(leaving, returning, after, before, min_days=1, max_days=270, n=10):\n\tafter = parse(after)\n\tbefore = parse(before)\n\t# a quick lookup map of dates to total costs for returning flights\n\tr_map = {str(d): t for d, t in zip(returning['date'], returning['total'])}\n\tn_best = []\n\n\t# iterate over each leaving day\n\tfor day in leaving.itertuples():\n\t\t# if the day is not within our date range, skip it\n\t\tif after > day.date or before \u003C day.date:\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\n\t\t# iterate over each number of days in the min, max range (inclusive)\n\t\tfor days in range(min_days, max_days + 1):\n\t\t\t# check if there is a returning flight available on current day + trip length\n\t\t\td = day.date + relativedelta(days=days)\n\t\t\tif after > d or before \u003C d or str(d) not in r_map:\n\t\t\t\tcontinue\n\n\t\t\t# sum of leaving and returning cost\n\t\t\ttotal_cost = day.total + r_map[str(d)]\n\t\t\t# update n best items, maintaining length \u003C= n\n\t\t\tn_best += [(total_cost, day.date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), d.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'), days)]\n\t\t\tn_best = sorted(n_best, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\t\t\tn_best = n_best[:n]\n\n\treturn n_best\n```\n\nWith this function, we can finally do what our original goal was, which is to find the best priced tickets. Let's suppose I want a 10 to 20 day trip between March 1, 2024 and May 31, 2024. Here is the result of that, using our round-trip data as input.\n\n![Air Premia best possible tickets given parameters](/premia_7.png)\n\nIt seems like we have quite a few options that are all $1,078. Let's see if we get a better price using our one-way data as input. Rather than buying both tickets together, you would have to purchase them separately.\n\n![Air Premia best possible tickets given parameters with one-way data](/premia_8.png)\n\nAs it turns out, we can actually get tickets for $57 cheaper by just buying two one-way tickets instead of round-trip tickets. I had always assumed that round-trip tickets would be cheaper than two one-way tickets, but I guess that's not always the case.\n\nMission complete. I still would like to plot some data so that we can get a sense for when tickets are cheaper and maybe uncover some other interesting patterns.\n\nLet's import [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) so that we can do some data visualization. I'm changing the default pyplot size and DPI to make the output wider and higher resolution.\n\n```py\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (17, 4)\nplt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 200\n```\n\nLet's start by showing the prices for different days. I'll split this into two charts. One for one-way trips and another for round-trips. Some of the bars will overlap one another but you can still see the general pattern, which is what we're after. *Note: the code for round-trip tickets is almost identical.*\n\n```py\nplt.title('USD Cost of One-way Economy Tickets')\nplt.bar(icn_ow['date'], icn_ow['total'], color='C0', label='EWR -> ICN')\nplt.bar(ewr_ow['date'], ewr_ow['total'], color='C6', label='ICN -> EWR')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n![Air Premia USD Cost of One-way Economy Tickets](/premia_5.png)\n![Air Premia USD Cost of Round-trip Economy Tickets](/premia_6.png)\n\nLet's check out what the price difference between one-way and round-trip tickets for the same flight is. We will use the following code which computes `one way cost - round trip cost`. If this number is positive, that means one-way costs more. If it's negative, round-trip costs more. *Note: the code for tickets to Newark is almost identical.*\n\n```py\nplt.title('USD Price Difference Between One-way and Round-trip Tickets to Incheon')\nplt.bar(icn_ow['date'], icn_ow['total'] - icn_rt['total'], color='C0')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n![Air Premia USD Price Difference Between One-way and Round-trip Tickets to Incheon](/premia_9.png)\n![Air Premia USD Price Difference Between One-way and Round-trip Tickets to Newark](/premia_10.png)\n\nWell now that we have a graphical understanding of the price difference, let's get a numerical sense for it by taking the mean of the differences.\n\n```py\n(icn_ow['total'] - icn_rt['total']).mean(), (ewr_ow['total'] - ewr_rt['total']).mean()\n```\n\nThe result of this is about `(104.19, -137.54)`. This means that on average, you are saving $104.19 on the tickets to your location by buying round-trip, but you are losing $138.54 on the return tickets. A pair of round-trip tickets is about $33.35 more expensive than two one-way tickets.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations if you've made it this far. You must really like data scraping. I hope you've enjoyed and that you can take the data and create your own visualizations. As an aside, I did check if there was any price difference between currencies, but they all came out to about the same when converted to USD. Good luck and happy coding.\n",html:"\u003Cp>A story on how I beat every travel site to the punch to book the best round-trip flights to South Korea. \u003Ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/xDimGG/eaf80e2dfac2e920ca023306b9e72437\">TL;DR\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Some Background\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>There is this relatively new airline called Air Premia that provides non-stop flights from four American airports to Incheon Airport in South Korea.

If not, you can stop reading here. If you're like me and you have, then boy, do I have a lot to say about this. Here are three pretty common proverbs that you should always have in mind.\n\n- Perfection is the enemy of good\n- Every expert was once a beginner\n- Comparison is the thief of joy\n\n## Perfection is the enemy of good\nI wish I could give an idea that would guarantee you success/happiness/whatever metric of good. Literally no one can. Some people have better ideas than others, but no matter who you are, most of your ideas will fall flat on their face. As long as you think your idea is good enough and you would enjoy doing it, you gotta see it through.\n\nDon't base your success on the utility or popularity of your implementation. There is a plethora of variables at play for the function that is success, and the idea itself is only a tiny part of it. In general, focus on an idea that actually intrigues you and gives you something to play around with.\n\nDon't be afraid to take on an idea because it's \"too big\". Most of the time, it's really not. You might just be missing one or two pieces of the puzzle. Tackle those challenges first. Suppose you have the idea to build a YouTube clone but you're worried that you won't be able to make a good recommendation algorithm. You're also not sure how you would handle storing files and video processing. You are already a skilled Web Developer who can definitely make most of the frontend and backend but are not sure how to go about those things. What should you do? If you're like me, then these seemingly impossible tasks will constantly linger in your head. All you'll be thinking about is how you should do those two things and keep reading articles on the topic. You look at how other people have tackled the problem before you and find out that there are entire areas of research dedicated to this topic. The complexity is overwhelming. All the while you still haven't written a single line of code. \"Eh, fuck it\", you say, before forgetting about the idea and moving onto your next idea, only to repeat the cycle.\n\nListen. If it's your first time dealing with a recommendation system and video processing, you are not going to do a perfect job. You're probably not even going to do a decent job. And that's OK. Just get it working. Write some basic code to do this so that you can integrate it into the rest of the project later. Focus on the \"impossible\" tasks before moving onto the stuff you're more familiar with. Get a working solution, regardless of how bad it is. Perhaps during your process of making a shitty solution you come up with a slightly better one. You never know until you try.\n\n## Every expert was once a beginner\nIt's very easy to see someone who's particularly good at something and think about how far from them you are. I am a firm believer of the 10,000-hour rule — the basic idea being that it takes about 10,000 hours to become an expert in any field. Think about how much free time you have per week. Based on that, this is how long it would take you to become an expert.\n\n| hrs/week | yrs to reach 10,000 hrs |\n| ---      | ---                     |\n| 10       | 19.2                    |\n| 20       | 9.6                     |\n| 30       | 6.4                     |\n| 40       | 4.8                     |\n| 50       | 3.8                     |\n| 60       | 3.2                     |\n\nThat person who's really good at something probably wouldn't even consider themselves an expert. This is about how long it would take you to be at least as good as them. Don't let their expertise intimidate you. You should strive to learn and improve your own skills. All you have in life is time, so you'd better use it wisely.\n\n## Comparison is the thief of joy\nI'm starting to realise there's a ton of overlap in all these quotes. Look, you need to stop comparing your idea to others' implementations. It's easy to look at other people's implementation of your idea and convince yourself that your version will never be as good. If you want to make a project, just make that project. In the end, you will learn something from it and that's 50x more valuable than whatever you've created. Time on Earth is short, so make the most of it. Whatever project it is you wanted to start on, go start on it. It'll probably suck, but you can always iterate, and you'll always learn something from each iteration.\n\n## Conclusion\n[Take it away, Bobby.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU)\n",html:"\u003Cp>Have you ever thought about making some project, app, post, video, etc. and eventually convinced yourself it&#39;s not worth it because it&#39;s already been done before and probably better than you ever could?

Based on that, this is how long it would take you to become an expert.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ctable>\n\u003Cthead>\n\u003Ctr>\n\u003Cth>hrs/week\u003C/th>\n\u003Cth>yrs to reach 10,000 hrs\u003C/th>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003C/thead>\n\u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\n\u003Ctd>10\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>19.2\u003C/td>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003Ctr>\n\u003Ctd>20\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>9.6\u003C/td>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003Ctr>\n\u003Ctd>30\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>6.4\u003C/td>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003Ctr>\n\u003Ctd>40\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>4.8\u003C/td>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003Ctr>\n\u003Ctd>50\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>3.8\u003C/td>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003Ctr>\n\u003Ctd>60\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>3.2\u003C/td>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003C/tbody>\u003C/table>\n\u003Cp>That person who&#39;s really good at something probably wouldn&#39;t even consider themselves an expert. This is about how long it would take you to be at least as good as them. Don&#39;t let their expertise intimidate you. You should strive to learn and improve your own skills. All you have in life is time, so you&#39;d better use it wisely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Comparison is the thief of joy\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I&#39;m starting to realise there&#39;s a ton of overlap in all these quotes. Look, you need to stop comparing your idea to others&#39; implementations. It&#39;s easy to look at other people&#39;s implementation of your idea and convince yourself that your version will never be as good. If you want to make a project, just make that project. In the end, you will learn something from it and that&#39;s 50x more valuable than whatever you&#39;ve created. Time on Earth is short, so make the most of it. Whatever project it is you wanted to start on, go start on it. It&#39;ll probably suck, but you can always iterate, and you&#39;ll always learn something from each iteration.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Conclusion\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU\">Take it away, Bobby.\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n",title:"Better Done Than Perfect",date:1706634774106,tags:["life"]},{id:"me",content:"{\n\t\"title\": \"Who is Angelo Lloti?\",\n\t\"date\": 1706565915390,\n\t\"tags\": [\"life\", \"self\"]\n}\n---\n\nThanks for asking. My name's Angelo. My favorite color is purple. My birthday is December 1st. I like the following things.\n\n- Bicycles (repairing and riding)\n- Caffeine\n- Computers (building, fixing, and using)\n- Mathematics (mostly number theory)\n- Solving Pointless Problems \\(Advent of Code, Codeforces, Leetcode, Project Euler\\)\n- Teaching (mainly through YouTube videos)\n- Web Scraping\n\nI like other things too; these are just the main ones.\n\n## Games\nI used to play video games a lot. I don't really play them any more. In case you play/have played games, here is a list of my top 5.\n\n#### #5: Bloons TD 1 through 6 (151 hours on Steam, many more on mobile)\nI have played this game on Cool Math Games in elementary school all the way through college. Isn't it just great watching monkeys throw darts at ballons?\n\n#### #4: Grand Theft Auto V (968 hours on Steam, ~200 hours on Xbox 360)\nSuper fun story mode. Super fun online mode. It's hard not to love this game.\n\n#### #3: Minecraft (countless hours)\nMy childhood was basically just Minecraft and my time spent with friends on this game. It's a great game that encouraged me to be more creative. It also introduced me to hosting my own game server and using a command line.\n\n#### #2: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (2,088 hours on Steam)\nI have way too many hours on this game. It would be strange if it wasn't in my top 5. There are so many areas to improve upon in this game (aiming, movement, communication, utility usage, economy) and so many community servers and game modes that you can spend hundreds or maye even thousands of hours on (like I have done).\n\n#### #1: Terraria (628 hours on Steam)\nTerraria is a sick fucking game. You can ride a unicorn, shoot a rainbow gun, invert your screen, and fight Cthulu all at the same time. The amount of bosses in this game is great and if you ever by the slightest chance get bored of the game's base content, the mods are even more incredible. Such a fun game with so many good memories.\n\n## What I Mostly Do\nI write code. The result of that code is usually in the form of a webpage like the one you see right now. Sometimes it's a [chat bot](https://github.com/xDimGG/starboard) which you can interact with through Discord. Sometimes it's a [Tampermonkey script](https://github.com/xDimGG/xdimgg.github.io/blob/master/remove-youtube-end-cards/endcard.user.js) that modifies your webpage. Sometimes it's an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steamapi) that conveniently wraps an API for you. Sometimes it's code that [solves a problem](https://github.com/xDimGG/aoc-solutions). Sometimes it's [code](https://gist.github.com/xDimGG/cc5d80bb2512f2525dd9f52fe4749a32) that scrapes an airline site and gets the best prices for a round flight in a range of dates. Sometimes it's a [GitHub Action](https://recurse-eats.dim.codes/) with a cron task that scrapes Uber eats for BOGO deals in some particular area.\n\n## Bikes\nI like taking things apart and putting them back together. Sometimes I break that thing in the process. I had a fairly rusty 6-year-old mountain bike that was left out in the rain for many college semesters. Here it is after I took it apart, removed a bunch of rust, spray painted some bits, and gave it some new grease, handlebars, pedals, and a chain.\n\n![my mountain bike after repairing it](/me_1.jpeg)\n\nI managed to strip all the threads in both crank arms, lose a cable routing plastic bit, and lose a spring in the process. Patched it up with duct tape and the bike rides well. If you need a mechanic, hit me up.\n\n## Computers\nI got into building computers because I wanted to play computer games but I was only 11 so I didn't have much money. I explicitly asked my family not to buy me presents and instead to only give me money. Having 6 aunts meant that I was sure to be rich. Thanks to Linus Tech Tips, after collecting a healthy $600, I ordered all the parts that fit my budget. I got myself a brand spanking new R9 380 GPU, an i5-6500 CPU, and [some other parts](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/DimMagician00/saved/#view=PPmMnQ). That's right, a whole 4GB of VRAM. Certainly enough to run Minecraft and CS:GO. With Linus Sebastian by my side, I was able to put together a beast of a computer that would serve me for years to come. In fact, I still use that same graphics card in my PC 9 years later.\n\n## Teaching\nI've always liked teaching. I don't really have much public content to show for it; mostly just one-on-ones. I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshYVJHJid6Eniih46Ov5QQ) where I sometimes upload coding tutorials.\n\n## Mathematics\nI've always had good grades in math class. This led me to pay attention since I felt like it was the only subject I could understand. Or maybe I understood it because it was the only subject I paid attention in. Who knows. Chicken and egg. I like doing math problems from time to time and have recently done a lot of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.\n\n## Conclusion\nI hope you've enjoyed my ramblings and now know a bit more about me. To summarize, I like solving problems, be it mechanical, mathematical, or computational ones. If I don't understand something, I strive to understand it eventually. I have my vices like caffeine and YouTube. I want to know why we exist and how we got here. I want to learn everything but am aware that humans don't live long enough to do that.
